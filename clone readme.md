#Overview

In this project, a static version of YouTube was developed using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. The purpose was to replicate the front-end appearance of YouTube, including the layout of the homepage with video thumbnails, navigation bar, and a responsive design. HTML structured the web page with essential components like header, sidebar, video grid, and video descriptions. CSS was employed for styling and layout, enhancing the user interface to resemble the YouTube platform. JavaScript was added to create interactivity, such as video play buttons and search box interactions.
The project provided an opportunity to understand how a large-scale web platform like YouTube is structured, focusing on its visual elements without the back-end functionalities (such as actual video playback, user authentication, or database integration).
